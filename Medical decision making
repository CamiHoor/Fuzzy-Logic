Fuzzy logic is an important concept in medical decision making. Since medical and healthcare data can be subjective or fuzzy, applications in this domain have a great potential to benefit a lot by using fuzzy-logic-based approaches.

Fuzzy logic can be used in many different aspects within the medical decision making framework. Such aspects include[22][23][24][clarification needed] in medical image analysis, biomedical signal analysis, segmentation of images[25] or signals, and feature extraction / selection of images[25] or signals.[26]

The biggest question in this application area is how much useful information can be derived when using fuzzy logic. A major challenge is how to derive the required fuzzy data.
